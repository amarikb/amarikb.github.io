        <p class="pLocation1 gi-1-8x pStyle" cite="https://sites.psu.edu/alinpassion/2018/09/06/the-beginning-of-kpop/">"It all started in 1989 when Lee Soo Man founded SM Entertainment which later became one of the biggest entertainment companies in South Korea.  In 1992, a group called Seo Taiji and Boys debuted and changed the Korean music industry. They incorporated English in their lyrics and dance moves into their music which was the beginning of modern Kpop. In 1997, Park Jin Young founded JYP Entertainment. In 1998, Yang Hyun-suk, a former member of Seo Taiji and Boys founded YG Entertainment. These three entertainment companies are also known as the “Big 3” in South Korea because of how big and popular they are." -"My Passion" Penn State</p>

            <p class="pStyle pLocation2 gi-2x pStyle">Kpop auditions usually have 3 rounds no matter what type of audition (live, global, or online)<p>
              <ul class="listLocation gi-1-3x listStyle">
                <h4 class="gi-0-1x">Three Steps:</h4>
                  <li>Step 1: First round is about letting the judges see your talent. You fill out a form giving them the basics about yourself such as age, height, weight, date of birth, etc. You perform to the best of your abilities and hopefully be what the judges are looking for</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Step 2: Second round is a camera audition. This is seeing how you appear on camera. They ask you to introduce yourself in every language you can speak fluently. They then try to see your different face angles. If they are really interested, they will make you sing and dance again.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Step 3: Third round is the final audition in which they call you back and give you the contract. They make sure they want you by making you sing and dance again. They then give you the contract and read it with you.</li>
              </ul>

            <h4 class="h4Location2 gi-3x">Trainee Years</h4>
            <p class="pStyle2 pLocation3 gi-1-3x">Once accepted into a company, trainees are required to follow strict rules in order to stay at the company. i.e.
              Most entertainment give their idols a dating ban throughout their training years and minimum of two years after they debuted.
              Kpop members go through intense process of training and rehearsing in order to be perfect before they debut, and depending on their skills, some idols can be training for 5-6 years even with going to school. 
              Even after training all these years, it is up to the entertainment to decide an idol is ready to debut by conducting monthly test and accepting or rejecting the go ahead.

            <p class="pStyle2 pLocation4 gi-1-3x">
              When the trainees passed the final tests , they become solo acts or are formed into groups. 
              The trainees then record songs for an alblum that would be released to the public for the first time. Training never stops as 
              they learn a new dance for the song and also record music videos to present the title song. By rehearshing and releasing the song, 
              they have transition from a trainee to kpop Idol by making theor first public apperance and performance. 
              The track will often accompanied by promotion like a showcase and appearances on music show broadcasts.

            <h4 class="h4Location4 gi-3x">Comeback</h4>
            <p class="pStyle2 pLocation5 gi-1-3x"> "It is when a kpop group releases a new album or single, they do a comeback. They will have a promotional period of around 2 weeks to a month and they will perform at various music shows to promote their album. They will usually only perform their title track and a secondary track." -

            <h3 class="textStyle3 h3Location3 gi-2x">3.3. Disband/Leaving Group (Permanently/Temporarily)</h3>
            <!--cited from: https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/wjvw39/k-pop-guide-nct-bts-blackpink-->
            <p class="pStyle2 pLocation6 gi-1-3x">
              "Most groups sign seven year contracts, and while there are success stories who continue performing beyond that timeframe, the bulk of groups don’t make it that far. They either fail to rise or they have a smaller fandom that sputters out. They stay contracted although their activities decline and are no longer heard of until news of their official disbandment. The worst case scenario is groups who have one or two singles before their (oft small and struggling) company decides they’re a money pit and quietly disband them." - VICE
              <br>
              However instead of the whole group being disbanded some members either leave the group permanently due to scandals like Drugs or dating dramas or temporarily leave the group to enlist in the military (Korea requires all males 19 and older to serve the country for two years)
